            <p>Hello! Jodi Tivis here. Thank you for taking a peek at my site. One day it will be filled with my own creations, but for now a few nice placeholder photos will do.</p>
            <p>I live in Fort Collins, Colorado with my fianc√©. I work in Denver as a personal assistant and do photography on the side. I love to create, spend time with loved ones, and be outside!</p>
            <p>I have mostly been moving from place to place up until this point- from growing up in small town in New Mexico to living and climbing mountains in Alaska and swimming in the waters of Hawaii. All the while I have been eager to find my niche in the career world; and somehow University of Denver's Web Development Coding Bootcamp fell in my lap and I knew this was what I needed to jump into.</p>
            <p>I am brand new to coding and it is challenging me but I love the problem solving aspect of it and I am eager for where this journey will lead me.</p>
